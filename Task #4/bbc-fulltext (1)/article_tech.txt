Self-driving cars are already on our roads, and in order to be safe, courteous drivers, they obviously need to be able to see around them. For that, they have perception systems that include sensors like lidar units (spinning lasers that map the surrounding streetscape), and cameras. But just perceiving the world as it is isn’t enough. A good driver, whether it’s a computer or human, should also be able to predict where a car, or person, will be in a few moments.
